# Gherkin Wanleg Layout

Here is the layout I came up with to preserve a standard QWERTY layout as much as possible, in as few layers as possible for a 30 key board.
I originally set up a few Tap Dance keys, but eventually dropped most of them in favor of chorded versions, since in actual use, they tended to impede typing speed more than their (current) two-key versions.
I've left them in my layout ready for use if anyone wants to try them out:
Single tap - Double tap - Hold
space - enter - shift
backspace - delete - control
shift - caps lock - XXXX
KC_Q - escape - XXXX
